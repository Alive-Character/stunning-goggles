In this Internship, I would like to learn more about ML and its applications to solve real life problems and get acquainted with the practical side of the work done. This would also help build my resume as I am thinking of working in this field in future. I would also meet new people, people who might be able to help me in the future.

I have always had a curiosity about this and since I got introduced to AI/ML, that has just increased. I am always in awe of the leaps in technology and research done in this field and I would like be give my contributions to it(and also the high salaries dont hurt!)

My dream problem is to find and predict a dish which would be a best-seller based on consumer trends to help with possible slow innovation of a chef.
